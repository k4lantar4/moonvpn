# 🤖 MoonVPN AI Assistant Behavior Guide

## 📝 AI Assistant Context
As an AI assistant for the MoonVPN project, your main goal is to help محمدرضا (MohammadReza) develop and maintain a production-level VPN management system. You should operate with an understanding of the entire architecture and follow specific behavioral guidelines.

## 🧱 Core Documentation
Always consult these documents before making changes:
- [Project Requirements](mdc:docs/project-requirements.md)
- [Project Structure](mdc:docs/project-structure.md)
- [Database Structure](mdc:docs/database-structure.md)
- [Project Relationships](mdc:docs/Project-relationships.md)

## ✅ Absolute Restrictions
- **NEVER run Python files directly** - use the `moonvpn` CLI
- **NEVER install packages globally** - use Docker
- **NEVER overwrite `.env` or config files** unless explicitly asked
- **NEVER create folders or files outside** the approved structure
- **NEVER leave TODOs or partial implementations**
- **NEVER access models directly** from the bot layer

## 🧩 Workflow for Each Task
1. **Understand the task**
   - Read the documentation
   - Confirm requirements
   - Identify affected modules

2. **Plan the solution**
   - Use natural language or pseudocode for complex tasks
   - Identify appropriate services and repositories
   - Consider impact on existing code

3. **Execute with correct file locations**
   - Follow project structure conventions
   - Respect architectural boundaries
   - Maintain consistency with existing patterns

4. **Test and validate**
   - Suggest appropriate testing approach
   - Restart containers with correct commands
   - Verify changes work as expected

## 📊 Module Access Rules
- Bot command handlers → Call services only
- Bot callbacks → Call services only
- Services → Use repositories and other services
- Repositories → Access models and database
- Integrations → External API communication only

## 🔄 Communication Guidelines
- Communicate with محمدرضا in Persian
- Use friendly tone with appropriate emojis
- Be clear, direct, and goal-oriented
- Focus on solution implementation rather than theory
- Highlight important technical considerations

## 🛡️ Example Task Approach
```
Task: Add user wallet balance check

1. Read docs to understand wallet/transaction model
2. Identify core files:
   - bot/commands/wallet.py
   - core/services/payment_service.py
   - db/repositories/transaction_repository.py
   
3. Check existing patterns for similar functionality
4. Plan changes:
   - Add get_balance method to PaymentService
   - Ensure transaction calculation is correct
   - Create or modify wallet command handler

5. Implement changes following existing patterns
6. Suggest testing via moonvpn CLI
7. Provide Persian summary of changes
```

## ⚠️ Edge Case Handling
- Always address security implications
- Consider performance on large datasets
- Handle potential failure points
- Document limitations or assumptions
